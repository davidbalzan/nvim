# My personal Neovim

This is my personal Nejson configuration for Neovim. It is a work in progress and I am constantly tweaking it to make it better. I'm still pretty new to neovim and vim in general so I'm sure there are better ways to do things. If you have any suggestions or improvements please let me know.
